# üëã Hi, I am Thejas

I write code to solve problems, not just to pass tests. Over the last 5 years, I‚Äôve worked as a full-stack engineer building systems that people actually use‚Äîfrom internal dashboards that simplify decision-making to backend services that stay reliable under pressure.

I specialize in turning complex requirements into practical software using Angular, React, Java, .NET Core, Spring Boot, and modern cloud platforms like Azure and AWS. My experience spans building RESTful APIs, integrating cloud services, and deploying scalable systems with CI/CD pipelines. I believe in building things right the first time‚Äîbut knowing how to debug when things (inevitably) go sideways.

On the academic side, I hold a Master‚Äôs in Computer Engineering from Stony Brook University, where I also served as a Teaching Assistant for Computer Vision and Digital Image Processing‚Äîmentoring students while deepening my own foundations in applied algorithms and machine learning.

Whether I‚Äôm designing architecture diagrams or fine-tuning a SQL query, I‚Äôm always thinking about how the small parts affect the big picture. I'm especially drawn to work that blends engineering with user value, and I‚Äôm always up for a challenge that makes me learn something new.

# üèóÔ∏è Featured Projects
## Custom Image Processing
[Repository](https://github.com/TKEMPEGOWDA/Custom-Image-Processing)
- Implemented custom convolution operations from scratch for grayscale images, including Gaussian and mean filters, without using external image processing libraries.
- Designed and applied a separable Gaussian smoothing filter followed by gradient-based edge detection with tunable sigma and threshold values.
- Developed a Harris Corner Detection algorithm with non-maxima suppression and Gaussian-weighted corner metric computation using an 11x11 window.
- Constructed rotation-normalized gradient-direction histograms as local feature descriptors for each detected corner point.
- Matched corner features across two affine-transformed images and estimated the affine transformation matrix using a linear least-squares model fitting approach.

## 3D Animation & AR System
[Repository](https://github.com/TKEMPEGOWDA/3D-Animation-AR-System)
- Developed a 3D computer animation pipeline simulating rigid-body motion of a textured cube using geometric transformations and perspective projection in Python.
- Implemented custom line-drawing and texture-mapping algorithms for rendering polygonal surfaces without external libraries like OpenCV.
- Simulated realistic image formation through a pinhole camera model using time-varying translation, rotation matrices, and intrinsic camera calibration.
- Created an augmented reality system by overlaying animated 3D objects onto static background images with occlusion handling.
- Designed a stereo vision system producing red-blue anaglyph 3D video using dual virtual cameras to simulate depth perception for AR/VR applications.

## React Web-Based Transcription & Translation App
[Repository](https://github.com/TKEMPEGOWDA/Real-Time-Transcription-Web-App)
- Developed an React and Next.js web app for speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and translation using OpenAI Whisper.
- Integrated Web Workers for efficient in-browser ML model execution, reducing main-thread load.
- Utilized @xenova/transformers for real-time transcription and multi-language translation.
- Optimized processing speed and UI responsiveness by leveraging parallel execution and async processing.
- Styled the application with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive, modern, and user-friendly interface.
